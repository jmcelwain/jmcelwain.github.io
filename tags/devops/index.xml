      <description>Kubernetes vs Serverless We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Openshift, Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;distribution&amp;rdquo; of Kubernetes, for over a year now. Although there are definitely pain points with learning an API with such a large surface area, in general my experience as an application developer has been really positive. Although our biggest gains were effects of moving off an old school Spring/Tomcat WAR deployment model to Docker and Spring Boot, Openshift itself is packaged really nicely and seems to have a lot of commitment from Red Hat.</description>
