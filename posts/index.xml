      <title>Restoring S3 Suspend to X1 Carbon (6th Gen) on Linux</title>

      <description>My current laptop is the second in the X1 Carbon lineup I&amp;rsquo;ve owned. In general, it&amp;rsquo;s been painless running Linux. However, in this current iteration, I was surprised to find that suspend-to-ram functionality isn&amp;rsquo;t enabled in UEFI. Apparently, Lenovo is catering to a new Microsoft sleep state Windows Modern Standby that allows for devices to be more easily woken up when in deep sleep (think mobile phones). There&amp;rsquo;s a long thread on the Arch forums about this, and I was able to successfully follow this blog post in order to patch my system, with a few exceptions.</description>

      <description>Kubernetes vs Serverless We&amp;rsquo;ve been using Openshift, Red Hat&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;distribution&amp;rdquo; of Kubernetes, for over a year now. Although there are definitely pain points with learning an API with such a large surface area, in general my experience as an application developer has been really positive. Although our biggest gains were effects of moving off an old school Spring/Tomcat WAR deployment model to Docker and Spring Boot, Openshift itself is packaged really nicely and seems to have a lot of commitment from Red Hat.</description>
